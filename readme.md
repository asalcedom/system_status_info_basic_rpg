# Demo of QSYS2.SYSTEM_STATUS_INFO_BASIC in an ILE RPG program

This is a demo of QSYS2 function SYSTEM_STATUS_INFO_BASIC. It calls the functions only for the values needed and displays them on the screen. The API QWCRSSTS is coded and commented so you can compare how it is versus running the sql function.
